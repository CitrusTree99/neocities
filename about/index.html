            <hr>
            <p>My Name is ███████ ███████, I'm a 21 year old from Buenos Aires, Argentina. In the past I've gone by several usernames (and in the future I might go by new ones), but the current one is CitrusTree and it's here to stay for a while!</p>

            <p>I have a variety of interests including,but not limited to design, pixel art, digital art, history, philosophy, religion, mystery, horror, video games, worldbuilding, and much more! Right now I'm trying to further my knowledge of web design and other similar topics to hopefully get a job in the industry one day! Or at least freelance enough money to pay the rent.</p>

            <p>When it comes to media, I enjoy a varied number of music genres like Post-Punk and Post-Rock, House Music, EDM, Vaporwave, Synthwave, Alternative Rock, Indie Music and others. My taste in music is pretty varied and I can generally sit down and enjoy most types of music.</p>
