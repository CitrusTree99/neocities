            <hr>
            <p>This is my website, it's currently "indev" so to speak.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box">
            <p>For now I will just tell you what my future plans for it are: I primarily just want to have my own little personal website, maybe a little blog on the side for random thoughts and such, and a way to share projects I'm working on as a way to stop being a procrastinating dummy that never finishes anything they start! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <p>I will now make a sort of "statement" or "manifesto" on how I'm expecting this site to develop, because I'm bored like that and I need to fill up space for testing.</p>

            <p>Past personal static websites of mine have grown to be quite bloated and large, many pages that ended up being a pain to keep updated and under control and ultimately zapped the fun away from the project altogether. I also noticed I have a tendency to go off the hook <span class="crossed">(As you can see now!)</span> and end up adding features and little experimental things I just never really update ever again. Hopefully we can change that.</p>

            <p>Responsiveness and accessibility is another issue I want to tackle. While the site right now is sort of responsive by its simple nature, I know it will become more complex as I go, and maintaining responsiveness, mobile compatibility and accessibility for as many people as possible is one of my major concerns at the moment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <p>Other than that, I don't have any specific plans for the site. We'll hopefully grow this project together, you and me. Until then, I invite you to visit my friend Marijn Florence's website at <a href="https://marijn.uk/">marijn.uk</a> for actually interesting, polished content.</p>
