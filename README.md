This specific github project isn't really that open to modification by other people other than me, but the code is here open for display for anyone that wants to dive into it, fork it, modify it, copy it or just do whatever they want as long as they follow the attached LICENSE!

Have fun looking around! Hopefully this is better than digging through the source code in-browser.
